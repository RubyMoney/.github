> ⚠️ **Maintainer(s) Wanted — RubyMoney Needs New Stewardship**  
>
> Hi! I’m the current (and only) active maintainer, and I no longer have the capacity to look after this project—or any other gems under the **RubyMoney** GitHub organization.  
>
> **What we’re looking for:** An individual or team willing to take ownership of *the entire organization* (all gems, docs, CI, and Rubygems ownership).  
>
> **Timeline**  
>
> | Date | Action |
> |------|--------|
> | **Now → 30 Sep 2025** | Open an issue titled “Maintainer application” (or email `shane@emmons.io`) and tell us who you are, why you care, and your plan for the libraries. |
> | **1 Oct 2025** | If no successor is confirmed, every repository in RubyMoney will be **archived (read-only)**. No new issues, PRs, or releases will be possible after that point. |
>
> Security-critical patches will still be merged during the transition window, but no new features will be accepted.  
>
> &nbsp;
